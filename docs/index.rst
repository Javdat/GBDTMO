Welcome to GBDTMO's documentation!
==================================

**GBDTMO** is a gradient boosted decision tree method which supports learning multiple outputs within a single tree. **GBDTMO** constructs the predicts of all outputs or a subset of automatically selected outputs on a leaf. Compared with GBDT for single output, **GBDTMO** has better generalization ability and faster training speed. See `our paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04373>`_ for technical details.
